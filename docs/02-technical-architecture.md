# Technical Architecture

**MattGPT: From MVP to Production-Scale Architecture**

> This document outlines the technical architecture evolution of MattGPT, demonstrating intentional trade-off awareness and strategic technical planning from rapid prototyping to enterprise-grade scalability.

---

## Architecture Roadmap Overview

MattGPT's architecture follows a three-phase evolution strategy:

1. **Phase 1 (MVP):** Rapid validation with minimal investment
2. **Phase 2 (Production):** Scalable architecture for 10K+ concurrent users
3. **Phase 3 (Enterprise):** Enterprise resilience and observability at scale

---

## Phase 1: MVP - Rapid Validation

**Status:** ✅ Complete (January 2025)
**Timeline:** Current State
**Primary Goal:** Validate product-market fit with minimal investment

### Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 🐍 **Frontend/Backend** | Streamlit (Monolith) | Rapid prototyping framework |
| 🤖 **LLM** | OpenAI GPT-4 | Natural language processing |
| 🌲 **Vector Database** | Pinecone | Semantic search and embeddings |
| 🐳 **Containerization** | Docker (Local) | Local development environment |

### Accepted Trade-offs

The MVP phase consciously accepted limitations to accelerate learning:

- **Desktop-first UI:** Not mobile optimized
- **Limited scalability:** ~100 concurrent users maximum
- **No caching layer:** Direct database queries
- **Monolithic architecture:** Single application layer
- **Minimal observability:** Basic logging only

### Key Decisions

**Why Streamlit?**
- ✅ 2-week build time vs 3+ months for React
- ✅ Python-native (matches ML/AI ecosystem)
- ✅ Built-in state management
- ✅ Rapid iteration without frontend complexity

**What We Validated:**
- RAG architecture effectiveness
- System prompt design
- STAR methodology implementation
- User experience patterns
- Search relevance tuning

## Phase 2: Production Scale

**Status:** 🎯 Planned (Q2 2025)
**Timeline:** Target State
**Primary Goal:** Scalable architecture for 10K+ concurrent users

### Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| ⚛️ **Frontend** | React + Next.js | Modern, performant UI framework |
| 🚀 **API Layer** | FastAPI Gateway | High-performance async API |
| 🦜 **RAG Framework** | LangChain/LlamaIndex | Orchestration and tooling |
| ☁️ **Infrastructure** | AWS/Azure | Cloud deployment and scaling |

### Architecture Improvements

**Micro-Frontend Approach:**
- Component-based architecture
- Independent deployment pipelines
- Shared design system
- Progressive enhancement

**API Gateway Pattern:**
- Service isolation
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Authentication/authorization layer
- API versioning support

**Scalability Features:**
- Horizontal auto-scaling
- Load balancing
- CDN for static assets
- Database connection pooling

**Mobile-First Design:**
- Responsive layouts
- Touch-optimized interactions
- Progressive web app (PWA) support
- Offline capabilities

## Phase 3: Enterprise-Grade

**Status:** 🔮 Future Vision (2026+)
**Timeline:** Aspirational State
**Primary Goal:** Enterprise resilience and observability at scale

### Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 🌐 **CDN** | CloudFlare | Global content delivery |
| 💾 **Caching** | Redis | Response caching layer |
| 📊 **Monitoring** | DataDog/New Relic | APM and observability |
| 🔄 **Orchestration** | Airflow | ETL and workflow management |

### Enterprise Capabilities

**High Availability:**
- Multi-region deployment
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Automated failover
- Disaster recovery planning

**Observability:**
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Distributed tracing
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Performance metrics dashboard

**Optimization:**
- A/B testing infrastructure
- Feature flagging system
- Performance profiling
- Cost optimization monitoring

**Data Pipeline:**
- Automated ETL workflows
- Data quality validation
- Incremental updates
- Version control for embeddings

---

## Strategic Rationale

### 1. De-Risk with MVP-First Thinking

**Decision:** Start with Streamlit monolith instead of production-ready stack

**Rationale:**
- Validated RAG architecture effectiveness before infrastructure investment
- Tested system prompt design with real users
- Refined user experience patterns
- Minimized wasted effort on premature optimization

**Result:** 2-week build time vs 3+ months for React-based solution

---

### 2. Preserve Core IP Across Phases

**Decision:** Keep data pipeline architecture unchanged across all phases

**What Stays Constant:**
- Embedding generation process
- Pinecone indexing strategy
- STAR taxonomy and metadata
- Search relevance algorithms

**What Evolves:**
- Presentation layer (Streamlit → React)
- API architecture (monolith → microservices)
- Infrastructure (local → cloud)

**Benefit:** Minimizes technical debt and preserves investment in core IP

---

### 3. Demonstrate Trade-Off Awareness

**MVP Limitations Were Intentional Shortcuts:**

| Limitation | Business Justification |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Desktop-only | Target users (recruiters, hiring managers) primarily use desktop |
| 100-user limit | Portfolio showcase doesn't require scale |
| Monolithic architecture | Faster development, simpler deployment |
| No caching | Query latency acceptable for MVP validation |

**vs. Accidental Technical Debt:**
- Not "ran out of time to implement mobile"
- Not "didn't know how to scale"
- **Consciously traded features for speed**

---

### 4. Align Architecture to Business Goals

**Phase 1: Portfolio Showcase**
- **Target:** 100 concurrent users
- **Purpose:** Demonstrate technical capability to employers
- **Stack:** Streamlit monolith (appropriate for scale)

**Phase 2: Public Product**
- **Target:** 10K concurrent users
- **Purpose:** Viable product for public use
- **Stack:** React + FastAPI (horizontally scalable)

**Phase 3: Revenue-Generating SaaS**
- **Target:** Enterprise customers
- **Purpose:** White-label credibility platform
- **Stack:** Enterprise observability and multi-tenancy

**Principle:** Stack complexity matches business maturity
