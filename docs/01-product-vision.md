## The Credibility Engine

**Tagline:** *"Matt doesn't claim credibility — he proves it in real time."*

### WHY: Establish Credibility

**Eliminate Doubt**

The core purpose is to replace generic claims and shallow experience with instant, quantifiable proof.

**The Problem:**
- ❌ NOT: "Matt is experienced"
- ❌ NOT: "Matt knows agile"

**The Mission:** Trust.

Traditional portfolios rely on self-promotion and unverifiable claims. Recruiters and hiring managers waste time validating experience, and candidates struggle to differentiate themselves from generic resumes.

---

### HOW: Act as a Credibility Engine

**Automatically mining 115+ real projects to surface the right evidence instantly.**

MattGPT functions as an intelligent search and retrieval system that:

- **Surfaces Specific STAR Stories** - Structured narratives with verifiable context
- **Identifies Methodology Patterns** - e.g., "Scaled payments at 3 banks"
- **Quantifies Measurable Outcomes** - e.g., "Accelerated delivery 4x"

**Key Capability:** The AI doesn't generate claims—it **retrieves and presents proof** from structured, auditable source data.

---

### WHAT: Specific Outcomes

**The AI-Powered Guide**

MattGPT delivers verifiable outcomes for three primary use cases:

#### 1. Recruiter Vetting

## Data Model & Two-Layer Governance

**How do you ensure the AI's answers are trustworthy?**

By creating MattGPT as a system that is **reliable, auditable, and engineered for high-quality information retrieval.**

### The Two-Layer Architecture

| Layer | Technical Name | Purpose (The WHY) | Key Data Fields |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Layer 1: Integrity** (The Core) | Mandatory STAR Method | Guarantees every story has **verifiable context** and **measurable results (metrics)**, fulfilling the promise of "Eliminate Doubt" | Situation, Task, Action, Result (with metrics) |
| **Layer 2: Intelligence** (The AI Fuel) | The Tagging Systems (5P + Semantic) | Enables complex **Hybrid Search** and **Pattern Recognition** for the AI (e.g., "Scaled payments at 3 banks") | 5P Taxonomy (Person, Place, Purpose), Semantic Public Tags (O*NET/SFIA alignment) |

---

### Layer 1: Integrity (The Foundation)

**Mandatory STAR Method**

Every project in the MattGPT corpus follows the STAR framework:

- **Situation:** Context and business challenge
- **Task:** Specific objective or problem to solve
- **Action:** Methodology, decisions, and execution
- **Result:** Measurable outcomes with metrics

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ Ensures **no generic claims** ("experienced in agile")
- ✅ Forces **concrete examples** with business context
- ✅ Creates **auditable source references** for every AI answer
- ✅ Maintains **data integrity** across 115+ projects

**Governance Rule:** No project can be indexed without completing all four STAR fields + at least one quantifiable metric.

---

### Layer 2: Intelligence (The Discovery Layer)

**The Tagging Systems**

To enable sophisticated search and pattern recognition, every project is enriched with two tagging systems:

#### 5P Taxonomy (Private Metadata)
- **Person** - Role, seniority, team structure
- **Place** - Client, industry, geographic context
- **Purpose** - Capability area, transformation type
- **[Additional dimensions]**

#### Semantic Public Tags (Industry Standards)
- **O*NET Competencies** - Standardized skill taxonomy
- **SFIA Framework** - IT professional skills
- **LinkedIn Skills** - Common search terms

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ Enables **hybrid search** (semantic + keyword)
- ✅ Powers **pattern recognition** ("Show me all payment modernization projects")
- ✅ Supports **cross-project synthesis** (AI can connect related work)
- ✅ Aligns with **industry-standard taxonomies** for discoverability

---

## MattGPT AI Core

**System Prompt & Integrity Mandate**

### The Operational Mandate

**Your Purpose: The Credibility Engine**

The system exists to surface relevant STAR stories and connect patterns across 115+ projects, driving the user to the core thought:

> *"Matt consistently delivers measurable transformation results — and here's the specific proof."*

---

### Core Directive: Anchor Every Answer in Proof

**DO:**
- ✅ Anchor every answer in specific projects (citing Client, Title, Outcome)
- ✅ Lead with outcomes, then methodology (e.g., "Achieved 4x acceleration by implementing...")
- ✅ Infer user intent (Interview Prep, Due Diligence, Pitch) to tailor the response structure

**Data Logic:**
- Semantic search across STAR, 5P, and Competencies to prioritize relevance and pattern extraction

---

### The Archetype & Governance

**The Archetype: Trusted, Pragmatic Advisor**

The voice blends:
- **Strategic Advisor (60%)** - Executive-ready, outcome-focused
- **Pragmatic Operator (30%)** - Grounded in results, implementation-focused

**Tone:** Warm, confident, and professional—never robotic or buzzword-heavy.

---

### Non-Negotiable Guardrails

❌ **No generic career advice or philosophical answers**
- The system only discusses Matt's specific project experience
- No hypotheticals, no general industry commentary

❌ **No corporate buzzword soup or robotic language**
- Use concrete, human language
- Avoid jargon without context

❌ **Never pretend to know things outside Matt's portfolio**
- If a query falls outside the 115+ projects, acknowledge limitations
- Suggest alternative search terms or clarify scope

---

### The Integrity Mandate

**All answers MUST be auditable by providing a source reference to the underlying project data.**

**Implementation:**
- Every AI-generated response includes clickable source chips
- Each source links directly to the full STAR story
- Users can verify claims by reading the original content
- No "hallucinated" metrics or outcomes—everything traces to source

**Example Response Format:**
```
✅ Good: "Matt accelerated delivery 4x at JPMorgan Chase by implementing
         CI/CD pipelines and automated testing frameworks."
         [Source: Agile Transformation at JPMorgan Chase]

❌ Bad:  "Matt is experienced in DevOps and has worked with major banks."
         [No source, no metric, no proof]
```

---

## Project Scope & Boundaries

**MVP Definition**

### IN SCOPE: Must Do (Integrity & Proof)

#### 1. Data Structure
**Requirement:** All content MUST be schema-driven, utilizing the **STAR Method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) as the mandatory format for every project.

**Rationale:** Ensures consistency, auditability, and proof-based responses.

---

#### 2. Verifiability
**Requirement:** The system MUST provide direct **source references (audit trail)** from any AI-generated answer back to the source Key Metric or STAR Story.

**Rationale:** Maintains trust and allows users to verify claims.

---

#### 3. Core Query
**Requirement:** The Explore Stories interface MUST provide filtering by **Industry, Technology, and Key Outcome** for rapid comparison by the Vetting Analyst persona.

**Rationale:** Enables recruiters to efficiently screen candidates.

---

#### 4. Performance
**Requirement:** The Detail View (STAR Method & Metrics) MUST load in **under 1 second** to ensure instant, reliable proof delivery.

**Rationale:** Speed builds trust; delays create doubt.

---

### OUT OF SCOPE: Must Never Do (Focus & Anti-Chatbot)

#### 1. Generative AI Scope
**Guardrail:** The system MUST NEVER generate generic career advice, synthesize opinions, or answer questions outside the scope of the **115+ verified projects (tbc)**.

**Rationale:** Prevents hallucination and maintains credibility.

---

#### 2. Data Mutability
**Guardrail:** All displayed Key Metrics (e.g., "Accelerated delivery 4x") MUST NEVER be interactive, editable, or changeable via the front-end interface.

**Rationale:** Protects data integrity and prevents tampering.

---

#### 3. User Tracking & Personalization
**Guardrail:** The MVP MUST NEVER include user logins, account creation, or attempt to personalize content based on browsing history.

**Rationale:** Reduces complexity; focuses on core value delivery.

---

#### 4. Monetization Features
**Guardrail:** The system MUST NEVER include payment gateways, subscriptions, or premium content features.

**Rationale:** MVP is a portfolio showcase, not a SaaS product (yet).

---
