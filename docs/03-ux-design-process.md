## Search Pipeline Architecture

### How MattGPT Search Works

**System Metrics:**
- Stories Indexed: 115+
- Avg Response Time: 1.2s
- Retrieval Accuracy: 87%
- Vector Dimensions: 384

### Query Flow

```
User Question
    ↓
[Embedding + Intent Analysis]
    ↓
[Pinecone Vector Search + Keyword Matching]
    ↓
[Hybrid Scoring & Ranking]
    ↓
[Top 3 Stories Retrieved]
    ↓
[Response Synthesis with Sources]
```

### Architecture Components

**Semantic Search Pipeline:**
- Sentence-BERT embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- 384-dimensional vector space
- Pinecone vector database with metadata filtering

**Hybrid Retrieval:**
- 80% semantic similarity weight
- 20% keyword matching weight
- Intent recognition for query understanding

**Data & Processing:**
- **Story Corpus:** 115+ structured narratives from Fortune 500 projects
- **Framework:** STAR/5P framework encoding
- **Metadata:** Rich tagging (client, domain, outcomes, metrics)

**Response Generation:**
- Context-aware retrieval (top-k=30)
- Multi-mode synthesis (Narrative/Key Points/Deep Dive)
- Source attribution with confidence scoring

### Search & Retrieval Details

**Semantic Search:**
- Pinecone cosine similarity (80% weight)
- Keyword: BM25-style token overlap (20% weight)
- Minimum similarity threshold: 0.15
- Top-k pool: 30 candidates before ranking

**Response Synthesis:**
- Rank top 3 stories by blended score
- Generate 3 views from same sources:
  - **Narrative:** 1-paragraph summary
  - **Key Points:** 3-4 bullets
  - **Deep Dive:** Full STAR breakdown
- Interactive source chips with confidence %

**Key Differentiators:**
- Hybrid retrieval ensures both semantic understanding and exact term matching
- Multi-mode synthesis provides flexible presentation for different use cases
- Context locking allows follow-up questions on specific stories
- Off-domain gating with suggestion chips prevents poor matches

1. **Product & Innovation**
   - Cloud-Native Development
   - Platform Engineering
   - Digital Product Development
   - User-Centered Design
   - API-First Architecture

2. **Platform Engineering**
   - Cloud-Native Development
   - Microservices Architecture
   - CI/CD Automation
   - Infrastructure as Code
   - Site Reliability Engineering

3. **Agile at Scale**
   - Large-Scale Transformations
   - Team-Building Frameworks

---

#### Leadership Philosophy

**Section Title:** "Leadership Philosophy"

**Four Values (2x2 grid of gradient pill cards):**

1. **🎯 Outcomes Over Syntax**
   - Business value comes first. Technical excellence serves outcomes, not the other way around. I prioritize solutions that deliver measurable impact over architectural purity.

2. **📈 Experimentation Culture**
   - Innovation requires permission to fail. I create environments where teams can experiment safely, learn fast, and iterate toward breakthrough solutions.

3. **🤝 Servant Leadership**
   - Great leaders remove blockers, not make decisions. I focus on empowering teams, building trust, and creating conditions for autonomous, high-velocity delivery.

4. **📊 Continuous Learning**
   - Curiosity compounds. I invest in learning new technologies, testing assumptions, and sharing knowledge — because stagnation is the biggest risk.

#### How I Built MattGPT

**Section Title:** "How I Built MattGPT"

**The Problem:**
"Traditional portfolios are static PDFs that don't scale. Recruiters and hiring managers can't easily search 115+ projects by methodology, outcome, or domain. I wanted to create an intelligent, conversational interface that understands intent and surfaces verifiable proof."

**Tech Stack (Icon Pills):**
- Python 3.11
- Streamlit (MVP)
- OpenAI GPT-4
- Pinecone
- Sentence Transformers
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Netlify

**System Architecture Flow:**

```
Data Ingestion → Embedding → Vector Store → Hybrid Search
     ↓              ↓            ↓              ↓
Source Data    AI Data Index  Pinecone    RAG Orchestrator
(JSONL)        (Vectors)                  (LLM)
```

**The Secret Sauce: Hybrid Retrieval Strategy**

```python
def hybrid_search(query: str, alpha: float = 0.8) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Blends semantic similarity (80%) with keyword matching (20%)
    to balance conceptual understanding with exact-term precision.
    """
    semantic_results = pinecone_query(embed(query), top_k=30)
    keyword_results = bm25(query, corpus, top_k=30)

    return blend_scores(semantic_results, keyword_results,
                       alpha=alpha)
```

**What MattGPT Can Do:**

**🧠 LLM-Powered**
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) using structured STAR stories and semantic search
- Automated tag generation using ontology and keyword extraction
- Embedded classification to discover similar or complementary projects
- Ask for insights in plain English — no keyword guessing

**🔍 Hybrid Retrieval Strategy**
