## The Problem

Traditional portfolios are static PDFs that don't scale. Recruiters and hiring managers can't easily search 115+ projects by methodology, outcome, or domain.

**The Core Issues:**

‚ùå **Generic, Unverifiable Claims**
- "Experienced in agile transformation"
- "Skilled in platform engineering"
- "Led large-scale projects"

These statements provide no proof, no context, and no measurable outcomes.

‚ùå **Inefficient Vetting Process**
- Recruiters spend hours manually scanning resumes
- Hiring managers can't quickly validate specific experience
- Candidates struggle to retrieve relevant stories for interviews

‚ùå **Lost Opportunities**
- Deep expertise gets overlooked due to poor discoverability
- Pattern recognition across projects is impossible
- No way to demonstrate methodology consistency

**The Mission:**

I wanted to create an intelligent, conversational interface that:
- ‚úÖ Understands intent, not just keywords
- ‚úÖ Surfaces verifiable proof from structured data
- ‚úÖ Enables rapid filtering and comparison
- ‚úÖ Provides auditable source references

This isn't just a portfolio showcase ‚Äî it's a **functional AI application demonstrating product thinking, modern engineering practices, and hands-on implementation.**

## Why I Built This

> **[PLACEHOLDER: Personal Narrative Section]**
>
> *Suggested content to add:*
> - What triggered the decision to build this?
> - Previous attempts or frustrations with traditional portfolios
> - Specific job search or client pitch scenarios that highlighted the need
> - Personal motivation beyond professional need (learning, experimentation, etc.)
> - Timeline: When did you start? What was the initial scope?
>
> *Example structure:*
>
> "In late 2023, I found myself in a familiar position: updating my resume for the hundredth time,
> trying to compress 20 years of transformation work into two pages. The process felt fundamentally
> broken. How do you convey the nuance of scaling engineering teams from 4 to 150+ people in a bullet
> point? How do you demonstrate pattern recognition across 55 banking projects when most recruiters
> will spend 30 seconds scanning your PDF?
>
> I'd been experimenting with RAG architectures and LangChain for a client project, and it hit me:
> What if I could build an AI that actually understood my work ‚Äî not through generic keyword matching,
> but through semantic understanding of outcomes, methodologies, and context?
>
> I gave myself 2 weeks to build an MVP that could answer one question better than a resume:
> 'Show me examples of Matt scaling agile transformations with measurable outcomes.'"

### The Secret Sauce: Hybrid Retrieval Strategy

One of the core technical innovations in MattGPT is the **hybrid search** approach that balances semantic understanding with keyword precision.

**The Algorithm:**

```python
def hybrid_search(query: str, alpha: float = 0.8) -> List[Dict]:
    """
    Blends semantic similarity (80%) with keyword matching (20%)
    to balance conceptual understanding with exact-term precision.

    Args:
        query: User's natural language question
        alpha: Weight for semantic similarity (0.8 = 80%)

    Returns:
        List of ranked stories with blended relevance scores
    """
    # Semantic retrieval: Understanding meaning
    semantic_results = pinecone_query(
        embed(query),
        top_k=30
    )

    # Keyword retrieval: Exact term matching
    keyword_results = bm25(
        query,
        corpus,
        top_k=30
    )

    # Blend and re-rank
    return blend_scores(
        semantic_results,
        keyword_results,
        alpha=alpha
    )
```

**Why This Matters:**

- **Semantic Search (80%):** Understands that "bootstrap it" and "start a new project" are conceptually similar
- **Keyword Precision (20%):** Ensures exact matches for critical terms (client names, specific technologies, role titles)
- **Re-ranking:** Boosts results by relevance + recency + credibility

This approach achieved **87% retrieval accuracy** with an average response time of **1.2 seconds**.

### Data Governance: The Two-Layer Model

**Layer 1: Integrity (Mandatory STAR Method)**

Every project must include:
- **Situation:** Business context and challenge
- **Task:** Specific objective or problem
- **Action:** Methodology, decisions, execution
- **Result:** Measurable outcomes with metrics

**Enforcement:** No project can be indexed without completing all four STAR fields + at least one quantifiable metric.

**Layer 2: Intelligence (Tagging Systems)**

**5P Taxonomy (Private Metadata):**
- **Person:** Role, seniority, team structure
- **Place:** Client, industry, geographic context
- **Purpose:** Capability area, transformation type

**Semantic Public Tags (Industry Standards):**
- **O*NET Competencies:** Standardized skill taxonomy
- **SFIA Framework:** IT professional skills
- **LinkedIn Skills:** Common search terms

This dual-layer approach ensures both **data integrity** (every answer is auditable) and **search intelligence** (pattern recognition and cross-project synthesis).

>
> **Challenge 1: Balancing Semantic Precision with Keyword Accuracy**
>
> *Problem:* Pure semantic search returned too many false positives. A query for "JPMorgan payments"
> would return stories about "Capital One banking modernization" because they're semantically similar.
>
> *Solution:* Implemented hybrid search with 80/20 weighting. This preserved semantic understanding
> while ensuring exact matches for critical terms (client names, specific technologies).
>
> *Result:* Retrieval accuracy improved from 62% to 87%.

## Conclusion

Building MattGPT has been equal parts technical challenge and product discovery. What started as a
solution to a personal problem ‚Äî "How do I make 20 years of experience searchable?" ‚Äî evolved into
a demonstration of modern AI product development: RAG architecture, hybrid retrieval strategies,
data governance, and user-centered design.

**The core thesis remains:**

> **Replace "I'm experienced" with "Here's exactly what I did, how I did it, and the measurable results."**

Every line of code, every STAR story, and every design decision serves that mission: **credibility
through proof, not claims.**
