# Streamlit App Polish Guide
## Ship Your Portfolio App in 1-2 Weeks

**Goal:** Apply "lipstick to the pig" - make the current Streamlit app presentable enough to use NOW for job search while you build the React version.

---

## Week 1: Brand Refresh (3-5 hours)

### Day 1: Apply Agy Brand Colors (1 hour)

**File:** `/ui/components.py`

Replace the current blue color scheme with MattGPT brand colors:

```python
# Find and replace in css_once() function:

# OLD (Blue scheme):
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #4a90e2, #6bb6ff);
color: #4a90e2 !important;
background: radial-gradient(circle at 30% 70%, rgba(74, 144, 226, 0.1) 0%, transparent 50%);

# NEW (Agy Purple/Indigo scheme):
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #8B5CF6, #6366F1);  /* Purple ‚Üí Indigo */
color: #6366F1 !important;  /* Primary Indigo */
background: radial-gradient(circle at 30% 70%, rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.1) 0%, transparent 50%);

# Update ALL instances of #4a90e2 ‚Üí #6366F1
# Update ALL instances of #6bb6ff ‚Üí #8B5CF6
```

**Brand Color Palette:**
```python
# Add this at the top of css_once() for consistency:
:root {
    --primary-purple: #8B5CF6;
    --primary-indigo: #6366F1;
    --primary-blue: #3498DB;
    --success-green: #2ECC71;
    --success-dark: #27AE60;
    --dark-navy: #2C3E50;
    --medium-gray: #6B7280;
    --light-gray: #E5E7EB;
}
```

---

### Day 2: Add Agy Logo (30 minutes)

**File:** `app.py` (line 307-310)

```python
# Current:
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="MattGPT ‚Äî Matt's Story",
    page_icon="ü§ñ",
    layout="wide",
)

# Updated with Agy:
st.set_page_config(
    page_title="MattGPT ‚Äî AI Portfolio Assistant",
    page_icon="üêï",  # Plott Hound emoji (or use actual Agy image)
    layout="wide",
    initial_sidebar_state="collapsed",  # Cleaner without sidebar
)
```

**Optional:** Add Agy logo to header
```python
# In render_home_hero_and_stats() or at top of app:
st.image("/path/to/agy_transparent.png", width=100)
st.markdown("# MattGPT")
```

---

### Day 3-4: Update Ask MattGPT System Prompt (2 hours)

**Current Challenge:** Find where you define the system prompt and replace it with the Agy approach.

**New System Prompt (based on your design spec):**

```python
# Add this to app.py (or extract to config file):

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
**Your Purpose: The Credibility Engine**

You are MattGPT, an AI assistant that helps users discover Matt Pugmire's professional experience through structured STAR stories (Situation, Task, Action, Result).

**Core Directive: Anchor Every Answer in Proof**

DO:
‚úÖ Anchor every answer in specific projects (citing Client, Title, Outcome)
‚úÖ Lead with outcomes, then methodology (e.g., "Achieved 4x acceleration by implementing...")
‚úÖ Infer user intent (Interview Prep, Due Diligence, Pitch) to tailor the response structure
‚úÖ Use semantic search across STAR stories, 5P taxonomy, and competencies to prioritize relevance

**The Archetype: Trusted, Pragmatic Advisor**

Tone: Warm, confident, professional‚Äînever robotic or buzzword-heavy
Voice blend:
- Strategic Advisor (60%) - Executive-ready, outcome-focused
- Pragmatic Operator (30%) - Grounded in results, implementation-focused

**Non-Negotiable Guardrails:**

‚ùå NO generic career advice or philosophical answers
   ‚Üí Only discuss Matt's specific project experience
   ‚Üí No hypotheticals, no general industry commentary

‚ùå NO corporate buzzword soup or robotic language
   ‚Üí Use concrete, human language
   ‚Üí Avoid jargon without context

‚ùå NO unsupported claims
   ‚Üí Every statement must reference a specific project
   ‚Üí If no relevant project exists, say so directly

**Response Structure:**

1. **Lead with the outcome** (What was achieved)
2. **Cite the project** (Client, Title, brief context)
3. **Explain the approach** (How it was done)
4. **Provide evidence** (Metrics, results from STAR)
5. **Offer next steps** (Related projects, follow-up questions)

**Example Good Response:**
"Matt has extensive experience in payment modernization. At JPMorgan Chase, he led a Core Banking Transformation that migrated 10M+ accounts to a cloud-native platform, reducing transaction processing time by 60% (from 4s to 1.5s average).

The approach involved:
- Architecting a microservices-based payment gateway
- Implementing real-time data validation
- Leading a cross-functional team of 25 engineers

This demonstrates strong capabilities in enterprise architecture, cloud migration, and large-scale system design. Would you like to explore other payment transformation projects or dive deeper into the technical architecture?"

**Example Bad Response (DON'T DO THIS):**
"Matt is an experienced technology leader with expertise in various domains. He has worked on multiple transformation initiatives and demonstrates strong leadership skills across different industries."
‚Üí ‚ùå Too vague, no specific projects, buzzword-heavy, no proof

**Remember:** You are the Credibility Engine. Every response should make the user think: "Matt consistently delivers measurable transformation results ‚Äî and here's the specific proof."
"""
```

**Where to add it:**
Find where you make OpenAI API calls and add this as the system message:

```python
# Look for something like this in your ask_mattgpt logic:
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": SYSTEM_PROMPT},  # ‚Üê Add this
        {"role": "user", "content": user_question},
        # ... context/sources
    ]
)
```

---

### Day 5: Quick UI Improvements (1 hour)

**Small touches that make a big difference:**

1. **Better Hero Text**
```python
# Update hero in render_home_hero_and_stats():
st.markdown("""
    <div class='matt-hero'>
        <h1>MattGPT</h1>
        <p>AI-powered portfolio assistant showcasing 115+ enterprise transformation projects through structured STAR stories and intelligent search.</p>
    </div>
""", unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

2. **Add Footer with Links**
```python
# At bottom of app.py:
st.markdown("---")
st.markdown("""
<div style='text-align: center; color: #6B7280; font-size: 14px;'>
    <p>Built by <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattpugmire/' target='_blank'>Matt Pugmire</a>
    | <a href='https://github.com/mcpugmire1/llm_portfolio_assistant' target='_blank'>View Source</a>
    | <a href='https://github.com/mcpugmire1/mattgpt-design-spec' target='_blank'>Design Spec</a></p>
    <p style='margin-top: 8px;'>Powered by OpenAI GPT-4, Pinecone, and Streamlit</p>
</div>
""", unsafe_allow_html=True)
```

3. **Improve Page Titles**
```python
# Make sure each tab/section has clear titles:
st.markdown("## üè† Home")  # or "## üîç Explore Stories", "## üí¨ Ask MattGPT", etc.
```

---

## Week 2: Content & Testing (2-3 hours)

### Day 6: Add "About This App" Section (30 min)

Create a simple "About" or "How It Works" section:

```python
# Add to Home tab or create dedicated About tab:
with st.expander("‚ÑπÔ∏è About MattGPT"):
    st.markdown("""
    **What is MattGPT?**

## Share With Recruiters

### Create a One-Pager (Email Template)

```markdown
Subject: Portfolio Demo: MattGPT - AI-Powered Career Assistant

Hi [Name],

I've built an AI-powered portfolio assistant that showcases my experience through 115+ enterprise transformation projects. Rather than a static resume, you can:

üîç **Explore Projects:** Filter by industry, capability, or client
üí¨ **Ask Questions:** Natural language Q&A with specific project citations
üìä **See Proof:** Every answer backed by structured STAR stories with metrics

**Try it:** https://askmattgpt.streamlit.app/

**Design Spec:** https://mcpugmire1.github.io/mattgpt-design-spec/

This demonstrates:
- AI/ML implementation (RAG architecture, GPT-4, vector search)
- Product thinking (UX design, information architecture)
- Full-stack development (Python, Streamlit, cloud deployment)

Happy to discuss how I built this or answer any questions about my experience.

Best,
Matt
```

## Optional: Advanced Polish (If You Have Time)

### Add Analytics (30 min)
```python
# Track usage in your app:
import streamlit.components.v1 as components

# Google Analytics or simple logging:
def log_event(event_type, metadata=None):
    # Log to file or external service
    print(f"Event: {event_type}, Data: {metadata}")

# Call in key actions:
log_event("search_executed", {"query": query, "results_count": len(results)})
log_event("ask_question", {"question": question})
```

### Add Sharing Links (15 min)
```python
# Let users share interesting stories:
st.markdown(f"""
<a href='https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=https://askmattgpt.streamlit.app/story/{story_id}' target='_blank'>
    Share on LinkedIn
</a>
""", unsafe_allow_html=True)
```
